                        In iOS 7, Apple introduced the possibility to [execute JavaScript via the JavaScriptCore JavaScript
                        engine] (http://nshipster.com/javascriptcore/). Unfortunately, JavaScriptCore is missing some
                        objects and functions a JavaScript environment of a browser would have. Especially the
                        `XMLHTTPRequest` (see the [Mozilla documentation]
                        (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) object needed for AJAX reqeuests
                        is not provided by JavaScriptCore. This library implements this missing object, so it is possible to
                        use JavaScript libraries which were originally developed for in-browser use in your Objective-C
                        (or Swift) application without the need to use a hidden WebView.
